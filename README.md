# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
# Machine Learning with SVM

## Overview
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification on a synthetic dataset. It includes data generation, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Generates a toy dataset using `make_circles`.
- Preprocesses data with `StandardScaler`.
- Visualizes data with scatter plots and heatmaps.
- Trains an SVM classifier.
- Evaluates model performance.



## Results
- Visualizations of the dataset.
- Feature correlations.
- SVM classification performance.
